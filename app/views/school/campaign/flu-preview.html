        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">About the flu vaccine</h2>

        <p>The vaccination is given as a painless spray into each nostril. It is safe and effective in helping to protect children against flu.</p>

        <p>Flu is caused by the influenza virus, which children can catch and spread easily. It can lead to serious problems, such as bronchitis and pneumonia.</p>

        <p>Vaccinating children also protects others who are vulnerable to flu, such as babies and older people.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is offered annually. This academic year, it will be offered to children in all year groups from Reception through to Year 6.</p>
