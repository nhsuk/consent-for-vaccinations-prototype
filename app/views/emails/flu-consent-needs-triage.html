  <p>Dear {{ name }},</p>

  <p>You’ve said you agree to {{ childName }} having their flu vaccination at {{ sessionSchool }} on {{ sessionDate | date("cccc d MMMM") }}.</p>

  <p>As you answered ‘yes’ to some of the health questions, we need to check the vaccination is suitable for Jamie. We’ll review your answers and get in touch again soon.</p>

  <p>The child health team</p>
