  <p>We wrote to you recently about a visit by a local health team to {{ sessionSchool }} on {{ sessionDate | date("cccc d MMMM") }}.</p>

  <p>If you want your child to get the flu vaccination during this visit, you need to give consent by {{ deadlineDate | date("cccc d MMMM") }}.</p>

  <p>The vaccination is a quick and painless spray up the nose. Even if your child had the vaccine last year, the type of flu can vary each winter, so we recommend they have it again this year.</p>

  <p>Responding will take less than 5 minutes. If you do not give consent, itâ€™s still important for you to respond.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">About the flu vaccine</h2>

  <p>The vaccination is a quick and painless spray up the nose. Even if your child had the vaccine last year, the type of flu can vary each winter, so it is recommended to have it again this year.</p>

  <p>The nasal spray contains gelatine. If your child does not use gelatine products, they could have an injection instead.</p>
