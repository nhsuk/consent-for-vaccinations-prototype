  <p>Dear {{ name }},</p>

  <p>Youâ€™ve told us you do not want {{ childName }}{{ knownAs }} to have their flu vaccination at {{ sessionSchool }} on {{ sessionDate | date("cccc d MMMM") }} because of the gelatine in the nasal spray.</p>

  <p>A nurse will be in touch to talk about the possibility of them having an injection instead.</p>

  <p>The child health team</p>
