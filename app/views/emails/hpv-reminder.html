  <p>We wrote to you recently about a visit by a local health team to {{ sessionSchool }} on {{ sessionDate | date("cccc d MMMM") }}.</p>

  <p>If you want your child to get the HPV vaccine during this visit, you need to give consent by {{ deadlineDate | date("cccc d MMMM") }}.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What the vaccine is for</h2>

  <p>The HPV vaccine helps protect against cancers caused by HPV, including:</p>

  <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
    <li>cervical cancer</li>
    <li>some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers</li>
    <li>some cancers of the anal and genital areas</li>
  </ul>

  <p>It also helps protect against genital warts.</p>

  <p>The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Please give or refuse consent</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="/hpv/start">Give or refuse consent for the HPV vaccination</a>
  </p>

  <p>Responding will take less than 5 minutes. If you do not give consent, it’s still important for you to let us know.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">About the HPV vaccine</h2>

  <p>Girls and boys in England are offered the HPV vaccination when they’re in Year 8. Young people usually only need 1 dose.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Talk to your child about what they want</h2>

  <p>We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccine before you respond to us. If they want to have the vaccine, they have the right to request this themselves.</p>
