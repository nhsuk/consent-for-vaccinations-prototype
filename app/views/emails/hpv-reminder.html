  <p>We wrote to you recently about a visit by a local health team to [name of school] on Tuesday 6 June 2023.</p>

  <p>If you want your child to receive an HPV vaccine during this visit, you need to give consent by Friday 2 June.</p>

  <p>
    <a href="/hpv/start">Give or refuse consent for the HPV vaccination</a>
  </p>

  <p>This will take less than 5 minutes. If you do not give consent, itâ€™s still important for you to respond.</p>

  {% include 'emails/_hpv-about.html' %}

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Talk to your child about what they want</h2>

  <p>We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccine before you respond to us. If they want to have the vaccine, they have the right to request this themselves.</p>
