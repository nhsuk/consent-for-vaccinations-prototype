  <p>Dear {{ name }},</p>

  <p>Thanks for answering the health questions about {{ childName }}. Our nurses have confirmed it’s safe for {{ childName.split(" ") | first }} to have the nasal flu vaccination.</p>

  <p>This will take place at Boringdon Primary School on Monday 24 November.</p>

  <p>We’ll let you know once Jamie is vaccinated.</p>

  <p>If {{ childName.split(" ") | first }}’s health changes, or you arrange to have the vaccination elsewhere, please get in touch. You can email example@nhs.uk or call 01234 321456.</p>
